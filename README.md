# Bayesian-Statistics

This repository contains my algorthm to a Bayesian Statistics assignment. The assignment consists of two main questions, each focusing on different aspects of Bayesian analysis.

## Overview
This assignment involves two major tasks:

Implementing a Gibbs sampling algorithm for a linear regression model and analyzing the posterior samples.
Developing a Bayesian search simulation algorithm to locate a fisherman lost at sea.

## Question 1: Gibbs Sampling for Linear Regression
In this part of the assignment, we develop a Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model. The key steps include:

### Specifying the linear regression model.
Implementing the Gibbs sampler to generate posterior samples for the regression coefficients.
Performing posterior analysis on the sampled data to derive meaningful inferences.

### Key Concepts
Gibbs Sampling: A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for obtaining a sequence of observations which are approximated from a specified multivariate probability distribution.
Posterior Analysis: Analysis of the distribution of the regression coefficients obtained from the Gibbs sampler.

## Question 2: Bayesian Search Simulation
In this part, we design a Bayesian search algorithm to find a fisherman lost at sea. The algorithm incorporates prior information about the fisherman's location and updates this information as new evidence is obtained.

### Key Concepts
Bayesian Search Theory: A method of search strategy planning that uses Bayes' theorem to update the probability distribution of the target's location.
Simulation: Running multiple iterations of the search process to understand the performance and effectiveness of the search strategy.
